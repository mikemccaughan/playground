A public repo for learning git

You'll need a GitHub account to become a collaborator. Create an account and add an Issue to let me know to add you.

Add files, remove files, update files, create branches, issue pull requests, etc.

- A nice cheat sheet: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/atlassian-git-cheatsheet
- Some info for people coming from TFS/TFVC: http://carlosschults.net/en/git-basics-for-tfs-users
- Same thing, but geared toward Visual Studio: https://roadtoalm.com/2013/07/19/a-starters-guide-to-git-for-tfs-gitwits/

Raise issues for any questions.

Happy coding!
Mike
